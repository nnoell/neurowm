neurowm
=======

*neurowm* is an extremely configurable, fast, dynamic tiling window manager for X. It tries to be similar to *xmonad*, where you must write you own configuration using **C language** instead of Haskell language.


Requirements
============

In order to build *neurowm*, you need the `libX11.so` library. You also need `libXrandr.so` if you want multi-head support.


Optional Dependencies
======================

If you want to run *neurowm* with all its features, install these packages:

 - **libxrandr**: for multi-head support (Enabled by default, edit `PKG_BUILD_OPTIONS` and `PKG_LINK_OPTIONS` in the Makefile to disable it)
 - **gmrun**: default application runner
 - **dzen2**: default system info panels
 - **xdotool**: default X11 command line


Installation using Makefile
============

Once downloaded, `cd` to its root folder and compile the source using the **Makefile**:

	make

Now install the headers, library and binary using the **install target** (you must be root):

	sudo make install


Installation using CMake
=============

Once downloaded, `cd` to its root folder and the `build` folder. Once there write:

    cmake ..
    
This generates the Makefile(s) necessary to perform the installation. Then, still inside the build folder, write:

    make
    
Finally, to install write:

    sudo make install


Configuration
=============

In order to run *neurowm*, you must firstly write your own **neurowm.c** configuration file in **~/.neurowm** folder. If the folder does not exist, create it. There are examples of **neurowm.c** configuration files under the **examples** folder.

The configuration file is actually a C file that will launch the window manager. The function that runs neurowm is called `NeuroWmRun` and it needs a pointer to a `struct Configuration` structure as parameter. You can either implement your own
configuration or use the default one. If you pass `NULL`, neurowm will load the default configuration so the simplest neurowm.c file you can write is the following:

	#include <neuro/wm.h>

	int main() {
		return NeuroWmRun(NULL);
	}

Once you have written your own neurowm.c file, compile it using the `--recompile` flag:

	neurowm --recompile

If you are running *neurowm*, you can also compile and reload the configuration file on the fly without restarting X by just pressing the default `mod+q` key binding.


Running neurowm
===============

Add the following line to your **.xinitrc**:

	exec /usr/bin/neurowm
